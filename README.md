# React Pomodoro Timer ⏲️

## Description 📜

The React Pomodoro Timer is a web application that implements the Pomodoro Technique to help users manage their time more effectively. This technique divides work into intervals, typically 25 minutes of focused work followed by a 5-minute break. The app helps users stay productive by providing visual cues and managing session timing.

The project replicates the functionality of the 25 + 5 Clock as specified by freeCodeCamp, and it is built using React. It includes all required user stories and features to meet the project specifications.
